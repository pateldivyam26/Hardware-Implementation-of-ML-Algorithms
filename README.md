# Hardware-Implementation-of-ML-Algorithms

This GitHub repository contains the implementation of machine learning (ML) algorithms on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board. The Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense is equipped with various onboard sensors, providing exciting opportunities for ML applications on hardware. The onboard sensors include:

- Voice: digital microphone
- Motion: 9-axis IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer)
- Environmental: temperature, humidity, and pressure
- Light: brightness, color, and object proximity

## Gesture Recognition

The [Gesture Recognition](https://github.com/pateldivyam26/Hardware-Implementation-of-ML-Algorithms/tree/main/Gesture%20Recognition) folder contains the implementation of a machine learning model for gesture recognition using the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board. The project involves collecting motion data for various gestures, extracting relevant features such as accelerometer and gyroscope readings, labeling the dataset, training a machine learning model, and deploying the model on the Arduino board using the TensorFlow Lite library. The results are obtained and displayed on the serial monitor.

## Weather Prediction

The [Weather Prediction](https://github.com/pateldivyam26/Hardware-Implementation-of-ML-Algorithms/tree/main/Weather%20Prediction) folder contains the implementation of a machine learning model for weather prediction using the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board. The project involves collecting external weather data, extracting relevant features such as temperature, pressure, and humidity, training a machine learning model, and deploying the model on the Arduino board using the TensorFlow Lite library. The results are obtained and displayed on the serial monitor.
